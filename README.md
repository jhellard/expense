## My process

I started with the layout, getting everything in place with dummy data. Once it was responsive and looked right I implemented dynamic columns and totals using the provided json data. Using Styled Components and Sass for styling, it made it fairly simply to replicate.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
---
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Main styling
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Adaptive styling (Dynamic Column Height)

### What I learned

While I have used Styled Components before, this was a good refresher for changing CSS properties using dynamic variables. The bar will dynamically change size depending on the amount.

It's always fun to try and achieve your goals as quickly as possible and I was very satisfied in the time it took me to put this together.

---

### Continued development

I would like to add a way to dynamically change the amounts in-app and store them locally on the users machine, allowing them to actually track their spending. I'm sure it will be satisfying to watch the columns populate as the days are inputted.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - For the 50 property names I couldn't remember, W3 Schools was always the first place I'd check.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Great website for more specific styling choices, lots of cool effects and interesting ways to achieve your desired effect.
